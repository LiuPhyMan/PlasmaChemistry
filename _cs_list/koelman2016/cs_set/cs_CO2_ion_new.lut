#CROSS SECTION DATA FORMAT
#In downloaded files, each collision process is defined by a block consisting of
#1st line
#Keyword in capitals indicating the type of the collision. Possible collision types are elastic, effective, excitation,
#ionization, or attachment (capital letters required, key words are case sensitive), where "elastic" is used to denote
#the elastic momentum transfer cross section and where "effective" denotes the total momentum transfer cross section (sum
#of elastic momentum transfer and total inelastic cross sections).  The latter is useful for solving the Boltzmann
#equation in the 2-term approximation.
#2nd line
#Name of the target particle species. This name is a character string, freely chosen by the user, e.g. "Ar". Optionally
#for excitation processes, the name of the corresponding excited state can be specified on the same line, separated from
#the first name either by arrow "->" (dash + greater than) or by double-head arrow "<->" (less than + dash +
#greater than), e.g. "Ar -> Ar*" and "Ar <-> Ar*", respectively. In the later case BOLSIG+ will automatically
#define the inverse superelastic process, constructing the superelastic cross-section by detailed balancing, and
#considering the indicated excited state as the target. In this case, the ratio of statistical weights must be input in
#the 3rd line (see below).  Alternatively, superelastic collisions could be defined explicitly as excitation collisions
#with a negative electron energy loss with user input cross sections and species name, "Ar*", for example.
#3rd line
#For elastic and effective collisions, the ratio of the electron mass to the target particle mass. For excitation or
#ionization collisions, the electron energy loss (nominally the threshold energy) in eV. For attachment, the 3rd line is
#missing. In case of an excitation process where an excited state has been indicated on the 2nd line using double-head
#arrow "<->", the 3rd line must specify also ratio of the statistical weights of the final state to the initial state
#as the second parameter in 3rd line this is needed by BOLSIG+ to calculate the de-excitation cross-section.
#from 4th line (optionally)
#User comments and reference information, maximum 100 lines. The only constraint on format is that these comment lines
#must not start with a number.
#Finally
#Table of the cross section as a function of energy. The table starts and ends by a line of dashes "------" (at least 5),
#and has otherwise two numbers per line: the energy in eV and the cross section in m2.

#DESCRIPTION:      A set of recommended cross section data (angle integrated) for electron collisions with H2, N2, O2,
#                  CO, H2O, and CO2. The data are taken from the tables in the references listed for each species.  The
#                  recommendations are based on available experimental data.  In that sense, the present sets of cross
#                  sections are not complete.  Uncertainty estimates are given in the references.
