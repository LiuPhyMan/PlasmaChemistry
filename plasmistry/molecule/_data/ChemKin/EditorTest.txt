 Hello... This is is a test of your editor 
 If you see this message, the editor is working properly. 
 You can close down the editor and return to the Preferences. 
 
 Notepad and Write (runs Wordpad) are popular choices for PC users 
 
 On Unix, the syntax varies by platform and may include opening an 
 X-window and then running the editor command as part of that window
 initialization (the -e vi command at the end runs the vi editor):
     Linux, SGI, IBM, Alpha, HP: /usr/bin/X11/xterm -e vi
     Sun:  /usr/openwin/bin/xterm -e vi
Some platforms also have simple alternative editors:
     HP, Sun:   /usr/dt/bin/dtpad
     SGI:  /usr/sbin/jot
     Linux:  /usr/X11R6/bin/xedit
